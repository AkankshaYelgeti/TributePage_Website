            <p class="n1">Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh.His father is a retired 
                technical officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna.[11] He was the youngest of five siblings and had 
                the nickname Gulshan.[12] One of his four sisters Mitu Singh was a state-level cricket player.[9] He attended the St. Karen's 
                High School in Patna.[12][13] His family moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his 
                schooling for intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply 
                interested in astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics.[14] He secured admission in the Delhi College of 
                Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering.
                According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied.
                He instead wanted to become an astronaut and later an air force pilot but was also interested in Bollywood, being a fan of 
                Shah Rukh Khan.</p>

                <p class="n1">During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.
                Soon afterward, he also began attending acting classes under the theatre director Barry John.Rajput later stated that he found 
                the experience to be liberating and wanted to continue doing it forever.He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom 
                Again song of Dhoom 2 and in Aishwarya Rai's performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.In 2006, he 
                dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and performance.He moved to Mumbai, took 
                up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre industry.Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group 
                called the Ekjute in which he remained for two and a half years.
                He was spotted by a casting team of Balaji Telefilms while he was working at the Prithvi Theatre.Rajput was subsequently called 
                for an audition and cast as a second lead in the television series Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil in 2008.He had secured the role 
                of Preet Singh Juneja, the stepbrother of the lead named Harshad Chopda and entered the show in its seventh episode.The

                looking on as his family celebrated coming out of difficult times.The performance had made an impression on the producer Ekta 
                Kapoor who vouched for him to be cast as the lead in another series Pavitra Rishta,[26] reportedly against the wishes of the hosting 
                channel, Zee TV.</p>
